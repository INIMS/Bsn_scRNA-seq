# Bsn_scRNA-seq
Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of N2A cells transfected with eGFP-Bsn

This repository contains the complete source code for the data analysis performed on the single-cell RNA-seq dataset described in Schattling et al. (submitted for publication).

The commented source code can be found in the R notebook scRNA-seq-eGFP-Bsn.Rmd. The output can be easily accessed without running the entire script by opening scRNA-seq-eGFP-Bsn.html in a web browser.
